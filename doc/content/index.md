# gcatlib

Gene and Chromosome Analysis Toolkit (gcat) is a C++ library for most
common tasks associated with genomic data files such as for parsing
FASTX, SAM/BAM, and GTF files. gcat is conceptually identical to 
`pysam` and `HTseq`, and borrows ideas from them.

## Installation

gcat is dependent on `HTSlib`.  The installation
procedure for `HTSlib` is described here. 

`gcat` can be obtained from here.

Untar the source files using
```
tar -xf gcatlib.tar.gz
```

Create a build directory with
```
cd gcatlib
mkdir build 
cd build
```

`gcatlib` is configured with 
```
../configure
```

The above configuration command works if htslib is
installed in the system path, and it will install gcatlib
in the system paths as well. 

If `HTSlib` is installed in non-standard directories,
the `configure` script should be executed with:
```
../configure CPPFLAGS='-I/path_to_htslib/include' 
  LDFLAGS='-L/path_to_htslib/lib'
```

To install gcatlib in a non-standard directory use:
```
../configure --prefix installation_path
```
Append the `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` to the above command if any 
of the dependent libraries are in non-standard paths.

Compile all the programs with:
```
make [-j threads]
```

Finally, install gcatlib with:
```
make intall
```
This will copy all the header files into `installation_path/include` and
the library files into `installation_path/lib`.

Of note, the Git repo does not include the `configure` script.
This can be generated by executing `autoreconf -i`.
